some text mining exercises in python

Data on Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews. Can be accessed here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews.

I did some exercises with texts of reviews: tokenization, cleaning, stopwords, frequency list, normilized frequencies, Kilgariffâ€™s simple maths, log-likelihood (G^2) and logratio metrics, random sampling and document-term matrix, pmi.

All in python.
